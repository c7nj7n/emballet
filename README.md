What is emballet?
-----------------

It's a mariage of our EMBA online courses at emba.mybeebac.com and ballet, smoothly dancing through the different courses and completing them one by one.

Installation
------------

The file is actually a JavaScript snippet to be bookmarked by your browser.
You then need to navigate to a given course and click on the bookmark, automagically the course will start to play and the different sections on the ride checked.

Limitations
-----------

Today you still need to select the chapters, since the snippet walks you only through all the sections (on the right, within the player).
You also need to keep the browser window active, otherwise the course will stop. Perfectly adapted to mute the browser window and watch the courses with a video player offline, in parallel to emballet.
